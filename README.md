# TikTok TTS API Reverse Engineering

## Description

This is a small Next.js project where I reverse-engineered the TikTok Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. The goal was to understand how the API works and to create a simple implementation for generating speech from text using the same method. Currently, the project supports only Brazilian TTS options, but I may add other voices in the future.

## Features

- Generate TikTok TTS from the browser
- Built with the Next.js framework (using Server Actions)

## Usage

1. Access the application at [https://tiktok.gabrielchaves.dev](https://tiktok.gabrielchaves.dev).
2. Write a phrase in the text input field.
3. Click the "Generate" button to create the TTS audio.
